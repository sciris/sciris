Welcome! We are thrilled you are interested in contributing to Sciris. This document will help you get started.

- The Sciris community follows a `code of conduct`_. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
- Sciris more or less follows Google's Python style guide, but with some exceptions. Take a look at the house `style guide`_.
- Feel free to `open an issue`_ on more or less anything! This project is small enough that we don't need a formal triage system.
- Pull requests should be made against ``develop``. In addition to following the `style guide`_, please make sure the tests pass (``run_tests`` in the ``tests`` folder; they also run via GitHub actions).
- If you have any other questions, please reach out to us: info@sciris.org. Thank you!
