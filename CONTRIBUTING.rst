============

Welcome! We are thrilled you are interested in contributing to Sciris. (No, seriously.) This document will help you get started.

- We are serious about inclusion and believe the open-source software community still has a long way to go. The Sciris community follows a code of conduct. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
- Take a look at our house style guide. Sciris more or less follows Google's Python style guide, but with some exceptions. 
- Feel free to `open an issue`_ on more or less anything! This project is small enough that we don't need a formal triage system.
- Pull requests should be made against ``develop``. In addition to following the style guide, please make sure the tests pass (``run_tests`` in the ``tests`` folder; they also run via GitHub actions).

If you have any other questions, please reach out to us: info@sciris.org. Thank you!
