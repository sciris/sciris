`Sciris <http://sciris.org>`__ is library of functions for scientific computing that provide additional flexibility and ease-of-use on top of Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib.

ScirisWeb, built on Sciris, is a toolbox that makes building webapps easy -- think of it as `Shiny <https://shiny.rstudio.com/>`__ for Python.
