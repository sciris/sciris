# Style guide

In general, Sciris follows Google's [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). If you simply follow that, you can't go too wrong. However, there are a few "house style" differences, which are described here.

## Design philosophy

Sciris is intended to make life easier, and the code should reflect that. Assume that the average Sciris user dislikes coding and wants something that *just works*. Specifically:

- Commands should be short, simple, and obvious. If you can't think of a name that isn't *all* of those things, that suggests the command might not have broad enough use to fit in Sciris. (But there are exceptions, of course.)
- Be as flexible as possible with user inputs. If a user could only mean one thing, do that. If the user provides `[0, 7, 14]` but the function needs an array instead of a list, convert the list to an array automatically (`sc.toarray()` exists for exactly this reason).
- If there's a "sensible" default value for something, use it. Explicit is better than implicit, but implicit is better than wearyingly nitpicky.
- Err on the side of more comments, including line comments. Logic that is clear to you now might not be clear to anyone else (or yourself 3 months from now).

## House style

As noted above, Sciris follows Google's style guide (GSG), with these exceptions (numbers refer to Google's style guide):

### 2.8 Default Iterators and Operators ([GSG28](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#28-default-iterators-and-operators))

**Difference**: It's fine to use `for key in obj.keys(): ...` instead of `for key in obj: ...`.

**Reason**: In larger functions with complex data types, it's not immediately obvious what type an object is. While `for key in obj: ...` is fine, especially if it's clear that `obj` is a dict, `for key in obj.keys(): ...` is also acceptable if it improves clarity.

### 2.21 Type Annotated Code ([GSG221](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#221-type-annotated-code))

**Difference**: Do *not* use type annotations.

**Reason**: Type annotations are useful for ensuring that simple functions do exactly what they're supposed to as part of a complex whole. They prioritize consistency over convenience, which is the correct priority for very low-level library functions, but not for functions and classes that aim to make it as easy as possible for the user.

For example, in Sciris, dates can be specified as numbers (`22`), strings (`'2022-02-02'`), or date objects (`datetime.date(2022, 2, 2)`), etc. Likewise, many quantities can be specified as a scalar, list, or array. If a function *usually* only needs a single input but can optionally operate on more than one, it adds burden on the user to require them to provide e.g. `np.array([0.3])` rather than just `0.3`. In addition, most functions have default arguments of `None`, in which case Sciris will use "sensible" defaults.

Attempting to apply type annotations to the flexibility Sciris gives to the user would result in monstrosities like:

```python
def count_days(self, start_day: typing.Union[None, str, int, dt.date, dt.datetime, pd.Timestamp],
               end_day: typing.Union[None, str, int, dt.date, dt.datetime, pd.Timestamp]) -> int:
    return self.day(end_day) - self.day(start_day)
```

If your function is written in such a way that type definitions would be helpful, consider if there is a way to rewrite it such that (a) it can accept a wider range of inputs, and/or (b) you can make it clearer what is allowed. For example, `values` should likely accept a list or array of any numeric type; `label` should be a single string; `labels` should be a list of strings.

Note that you *can* (and should) use type annotations in your docstrings. For example, the above method could be written as:

```python
def countdays(self, startday, endday):
    """ Count days between start and end relative to "sim time"

    Args:
        startday (int/str/date): The day to start counting
        endday   (int/str/date): The day to stop counting

    Returns:
        Number of days elapsed

    **Example**:
    
        sc.countdays(45, '2022-02-02')
    """
    return self.day(endday) - self.day(startday)
```

### 3.2 Line length ([GSG32](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#32-line-length))

**Difference**: Long lines are not *great*, but are justified in some circumstances.

**Reason**: Line lengths of 80 characters are due to [historical limitations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characters_per_line). Think of lines >80 characters as bad, but breaking a line as being equally bad. Decide whether a long line would be better implemented some other way -- for example, rather than breaking a >80 character list comprehension over multiple lines, use a `for` loop instead. Always keep literal strings together (do not use implicit string concatenation).

Line comments are encouraged in Sciris, and these can be as long as needed; they should not be broken over multiple lines to avoid breaking the flow of the code. A 50-character line with a 150 character line comment after it is completely fine. The rationale is that long line comments only need to be read very occasionally; if they are broken up over multiple lines, then they have to be scrolled past *every single time*. Since scrolling vertically is such a common task, it is important to minimize the amount of effort required (i.e., minimizing lines) while not sacrificing clarity. Vertically compact code also means more will fit on your screen (and thence your brain).

Examples:

```python
# Yes: it's a bit longer than 80 chars but not too bad
foo_bar(self, width, height, color='black', design=None, x='foo', emphasis=None)

# No: the cost of breaking the line is too high
foo_bar(self, width, height, color='black', design=None, x='foo',
        emphasis=None)

# No: line is needlessly long, rename variables to be more concise to avoid the need to break
foo_bar(self, object_width, object_height, text_color='black', text_design=None, x='foo', text_emphasis=None)

# No: line is too long
foo_bar(self, width, height, design=None, x='foo', emphasis=None, fg_color='black', bg_color='white', frame_color='orange')

# Yes: if you do need to break a line, try to break at a semantically meaningful point
foo_bar(self, width, height, design=None, x='foo', emphasis=None,
        fg_color='black', bg_color='white', frame_color='orange')

# Yes: long line comments are ok
foo_bar(self, width, height, color='black', design=None, x='foo') # Note the difference with bar_foo(), which does not perform the opposite operation
```

### 3.5 Blank Lines ([GSG35](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#35-blank-lines))

**Difference**: Always use (at least) one extra blank line between levels as within a level.

**Reason**: Google's recommendation (two blank lines between functions or classes, one blank line between methods) is appropriate for small-to-medium classes and methods. However, for large methods (e.g. >50 lines) with multiple blank lines within them, using only a single blank line can mark it hard to tell where one method stops and the next one starts. Thus, for a method that contains blank lines within itself, use *two* blank lines between methods (and then do that consistently for the rest of the class). For separating large classes/functions (>500 lines), or classes whose methods are separated by two blank lines, separating them by three blank lines is preferable.

While not explicitly covered by the Google style guide, **return** statements should be used at the end of each function and method, even if that block returns `None` (in which case use `return`, not `return None`). This helps delimit larger methods/functions. However, always ask whether a function/method *should* return `None`; if a function can return something that might be useful, it should.

### 3.6 Whitespace ([GSG36](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#36-whitespace))

**Difference**: You *should* use spaces to vertically align tokens.

**Reason**: This convention, which is a type of [semantic indenting](https://gist.github.com/androidfred/66873faf9f0b76f595b5e3ea3537a97c), can greatly increase readability of the code by drawing attention to the semantic similarities and differences between consecutive lines. (However, if you have too many very similar consecutive lines, ask yourself if it could be turned into a loop or otherwise automated.)

Vertically aligned code blocks also make it easier to edit code using editors that allow multiline editing (e.g., [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)). However, use your judgement -- there are cases where it does more harm than good, especially if the block is small, or if egregious amounts of whitespace would need to be used to achieve alignment.

### 3.8.5 Block and Inline Comments ([GSG385](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#385-block-and-inline-comments))

**Difference**: Use either one or two spaces between code and a line comment.

**Reason**: The advice "Use two spaces to improve readability" dates back to the era when most code was viewed as plain text. Now that virtually all editors have syntax highlighting, it's no longer really necessary. There's nothing *wrong* with two spaces, but if it's easier to type one space, do it.

### 3.10 Strings ([GSG310](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#310-strings))

**Difference**: Always use f-strings or addition.

**Reason**: It's just nicer. Compared to `'{}, {}'.format(first, second)` or `'%s, %s' % (first, second)`, `f'{first}, {second}'` is both shorter and clearer to read. However, use concatenation if it's simpler, e.g. `third = first + second` rather than `third = f'{first}{second}'` (because again, it's shorter and clearer).

### 3.13 Imports formatting ([GSG313](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#313-imports-formatting))

**Difference**: Group imports logically rather than alphabetically.

**Reason**: Sort imports as in Google's style guide, but second-order sorting should be grouped by "level", e.g. low-level libraries first (e.g. file I/O), then high-level libraries last (e.g., plotting). For example:

```python
import os
import shutil
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pylab as pl
import seaborn as sns
from . import sc_plotting as scp
```

Note the logical groupings -- standard library imports first, then numeric libraries, with Numpy coming before pandas since it's lower level; then external plotting libraries; and finally internal imports.

Note also the use of `import pylab as pl` instead of the more common `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`. These are functionally identical; the former is used simply because it is easier to type, but this convention may change to the more standard Matplotlib import in future.

### 3.14 Statements ([GSG314](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#314-statements))

**Difference**: Multiline statements are *sometimes* OK.

**Reason**: Like with semantic indenting, sometimes it causes additional work to break up a simple block of logic vertically. However, use your judgement, and err on the side of Google's style guide. For example:

```python
# Yes
if foo:
    bar(foo)

# Yes
if foo:
    bar(foo)
else:
    baz(foo)

# Yes, sometimes
if foo: bar(foo)

# Yes, sometimes
if foo: bar(foo)
else:   baz(foo)

# Yes, but maybe rethink your life choices
if   foo == 0: bar(foo)
elif foo == 1: baz(foo)
elif foo == 2: bat(foo)
elif foo == 3: bam(foo)
elif foo == 4: bak(foo)
else:          zzz(foo)

# No: definitely rethink your life choices
if foo == 0:
    bar(foo)
elif foo == 1:
    baz(foo)
elif foo == 2:
    bat(foo)
elif foo == 3:
    bam(foo)
elif foo == 4:
    bak(foo)
else:
    zzz(foo)

# OK
try:
    bar(foo)
except:
    pass

# Also OK
try:    bar(foo)
except: pass

# No: too much whitespace and logic too hidden
try:                    bar(foo)
except ValueError as E: baz(foo)
```

### 3.16 Naming ([GSG316](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#316-naming))

**Difference**: Names should be consistent with other libraries and with how the user interacts with the code.

**Reason**: Sciris interacts with other libraries, especially Numpy and Matplotlib, and should not redefine these libraries' names. For example, Google naming convention would prefer `fig_size` to `figsize`, but Matplotlib uses `figsize`, so this should also be the name preferred by Sciris.

Since Sciris prioritizes ease of use, many classes are given lowercase names (e.g. `sc.timer()`). This is to parallel libraries like Numpy (e.g. `np.array()`). In general, classes should only be given standard CamelCase names if they're *not* intended to be used by the user (e.g., `sc.sc_parallel.TaskArgs`).

Names should be as short as they can be while being *memorable*. This is slightly less strict than being unambiguous. Think of it as: the meaning might not be clear solely from the variable name, but should be clear from the docstring and/or line comment, and from *that* point should be unambiguous.

Underscores in variable names are generally avoided (e.g. `sc.resourcemonitor()`), but there are exceptions, especially for keyword arguments that have much higher readability with underscores (e.g. `sc.getrowscols(..., remove_extra=True)`).

## Parting words

If in doubt, ask! GitHub, email (info@sciris.org), Slack -- all work. And don't worry about getting it perfect; any differences in style will be reconciled during code review and merge.
