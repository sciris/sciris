# Contributing

Welcome! We are thrilled you are interested in contributing to Sciris. (No, seriously.) This document will help you get started.

- We are serious about inclusion and believe the open-source software community still has a long way to go. The Sciris community follows a [code of conduct](https://docs.sciris.org/code_of_conduct.html). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
- Take a look at our house [style guide](https://docs.sciris.org/style_guide.html). Sciris more or less follows Google's Python style guide, but with some exceptions.
- Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/sciris/sciris/issues/new/choose) on more or less anything! This project is small enough that we don't need a formal triage system.
- Pull requests should be made against `develop`. In addition to following the style guide, please make sure the tests pass (`run_tests` in the `tests` folder; they also run via GitHub actions).

If you have any other questions, please reach out to us: info@sciris.org. Thank you!
